# Which level in BMILEVEL is most likely to not have a linear relationship with disease progression? What is the reason?
# How worse is the disease progression in unhealthy people compared to the healthy ones?
# How worse is the disease progression in unhealthy people compared to the overweight ones?

# Fit a linear model for predicting disease progression using BMILEVEL and the blood serum measurements. 
# From the model summary, explain how you will find out which blood serum measurements are most likely to have a linear relationship with disease progression.
# Fit a model using BMILEVEL and the blood serum measurements identified in the previous question and compare its accuracy with the model fit using BMILEVEL and all blood serum measurements.

# Fit a linear model for predicting disease progression using BMI, age, BP, and gender. How accurate is the model? 
# According to the model, which gender has a worse disease progression? Explain why.
# For the same age, BP, and gender, decreasing BMI by 1 unit causes what change in the disease progression?
# For the same age and BP, which gender benefits better w.r.t. disease progressions by decreasing BMI by 1 unit. Explain.
